## ü¶æ How does it work?
It gets info like current date, month, year, which year is next and so on. Then it calculates how many days and weeks there are till the end of the year. On the first day of the week (Monday) it will make a tweet which week number is starting and how many days and weeks there are left.

There are special tweets set for the last day, New Year and Christmas. On the first day of the year the bot will update the profile picture to reflect a new year.

There were more tweets set but were removed, so the bot did not tweet too often.

Most tweets now contain a random image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) to make them more interesting.

For communication with Twitter I am using Python library [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/), and for running the bot a Tasks feature on the [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) website, which allows you to set how often you want to run your code.

The bot is often updated as new ideas appear.
